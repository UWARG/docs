# WARG Docs

WARG Docs is the central repo for maintaining WARG Documentation found at [docs.uwarg.com](http://docs.uwarg.com). The documentation is generated by [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). You write your documentation in markdown files and it automotically generates a project docs site for you. 

# Installation
To install mkdocs, make sure you have python installed (any version works) and pip. Then run ```pip install mkdocs```

# Viewing Changes
To run an mkdocs server and view the changes you're making, run ```mkdocs serve```. Then go to  `http://127.0.0.1:8000` on your web browser.

# Deploying
Nothing needs to be done to be done to deploy the docs. A Jenkins server continuously monitors this repo. However, if you wish to manually deploy, you can use the following command:
`mkdocs gh-deploy --clean`
Note,  it is not recommended to manually deploy, without disabling Jenkins,  as Jenkins will automatically deploy the docs even if you did so manually.
